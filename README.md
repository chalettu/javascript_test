# javascript_test
This is a simple Node JS Javascript coding Test




So here is how you can edit this code if you want.  In the frontend_src folder it contains the angular code run an npm install and then run "gulp serve".

This will create a server to load the frontend content.


If you want to boot a server to see the whole project work I redid the server portion using SailsJS and it is under the sails/ directory. 

To boot the server download the code , go into the sails directory and run an npm install. 

After that finishes run a sails lift and it will start a server on port 1337
